# World Time App

A simple app to visualize time in different timezones categorized by country.

### Homepage

After loading the api you get send to the homepage with germany/berlin as a standard. 
It shows the location and the current tim in a 12h-format.

On the bottom left there is a floating-button to change location.

### Change location

To change the location you simply click on the floating-button on the bottom left.
This will redirect you to another page with currently 3 other countries (USA/Los Angeles, Japan/Tokio, Australia/Sydney).
Simply click on your desired country and you will get redirected to the homepage. 
But now it will show the location and time of your selected location.

Extra feature - The homepage-background changes according to the time of the current selected location.

### Future 

I haven't planned to expand the list of countries and/or features yet.
